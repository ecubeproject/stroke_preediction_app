    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "### According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths (annual mortality rate of 5.5 million).\n",
    "### Every year, more than 15 million people worldwide have a stroke, and in every 4 minutes, someone dies due to stroke.\n",
    "### Stroke is preventable in around 80% of cases. However, for prevention we need to find patients at risk i.e. patients with high probability of stroke.\n",
    "### Here we use machine learning to build a predictive model that predicts the probability of a patient getting stroke based on features like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status."

    "# I thought of sharing some domain related resources for the assignment as below. Stroke is a very major disease that has a long run physical and mental impact on the patient and often requires immediate life-saving support and operative treatment methods with a long run rehabilitation. It is a life-threatening disease if not treated on time. Stroke occurs when the blood vessels passing blood from the heart to the brain get damaged either due to plaque (Ischemic) or a rupture (hemorrhage). This is a life threatening disease and often paralyses certain body parts for a long time after initial life saving measures.\n",

    "   - The **KS test confirms this**, showing a **very high KS statistic (0.54) and extremely low p-value (<1e-60)**.\n",
    "   - The **Mann-Whitney U test reinforces this**, indicating that age distributions are vastly different.\n",

    "2. **Avg Glucose Level (Moderate Differentiator)**\n",
    "   - The violin plot showed that **stroke patients have higher glucose levels**, with a wider spread and more extreme values compared to non-stroke individuals.\n",
    "   - The **KS statistic (0.24) and p-value (<1e-10) confirm this** difference is statistically significant.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **BMI (Weakest Differentiator)**\n",
    "   - The violin plot **showed some overlap** between stroke and non-stroke groups, meaning BMI does not separate the two as clearly as age or glucose levels.\n",
    "   - The **KS statistic (0.19) is the lowest**, suggesting that while BMI distributions are different, the separation is not as strong as in age or glucose.\n",

    "### Stroke cases (orange) appear sparsely distributed across the plot.\n",

    "### This suggests that stroke vs. non-stroke classification may not be easily separable in a linear transformation of features.\n",
    "## **PC1 captures the majority of variation, while PC2 provides additional spread.**\n",
    "### The points are more spread along PC1, indicating it explains most of the variance in the data.\n",

    "## **Possible Overlap Between Stroke and Non-Stroke Groups**\n",

    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "### PCA confirms that the **stroke classification problem is complex and non-linearly separable**.\n",

    "# **Analysis of Forward Feature Addition (FFA) Results**\n",
    "## **Key Observations:**\n",
    "### **1. XGB and LOGIT show peak F1-score at 9 features**\n",
    "####   - Both **XGBoost and Logistic Regression** exhibit their best F1-score when using **9 features**.\n",
    "####   - This suggests that **9 features provide an optimal balance between model complexity and predictive performance**.\n",
    "####   - Beyond 9 features, the F1-score **declines or remains stable**, indicating diminishing returns from additional features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. RF shows peak F1-score at only 2 features**\n",
    "####  - Unlike XGB and LOGIT, **Random Forest achieves its highest F1-score with only 2 features**.\n",
    "#### - Adding more features **decreases performance**, suggesting that RF is:\n",
    "####     - **Overfitting when too many features are included**.\n",
    "####     - **Finding only a few strong predictors, while additional features introduce noise**.\n",
    "####   - This behavior suggests that **RF's feature importance rankings may differ significantly from XGB and LOGIT**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Interpretation of Results:**\n",
    "### **1. Should RF be used with 9 features like XGB and LOGIT?**\n",
    "####   - **No**, because RF performs best with only **2 features**, meaning that additional features hurt its ability to generalize.\n",
    "####   - However, we should **analyze which 2 features RF selects** and whether they align with the features chosen by XGB and LOGIT.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Should RFE be redone with only 2 features for RF?**\n",
    "####   - **Possibly, if RF is being considered for final model selection.**\n",
    "####   - However, since XGB and LOGIT perform best with **9 features**, using only 2 features for RF would make model comparisons inconsistent.\n",
    "####   - Instead, we can **compare RF's best 2-feature model against XGB & LOGIT’s 9-feature models** to see if RF still outperforms them with fewer variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Final Decision on Features:**\n",
    "#### 1. **Use 9 features for XGB and LOGIT** (since F1-score peaks at 9).  We will check this by RFE\n",
    "#### 2. **Use 2 features for RF** (since it performs best with fewer variables). We will check this by RFE\n",
    "#### 3. **Compare performance between RF's 2-feature model and XGB/LOGIT's 9-feature models**"

    "####    - **Before SMOTE**, RF selected `avg_glucose_level` and `bmi` as the top 2 features.  \n",
    "####    - **After SMOTE**, RF prefers `age` and `avg_glucose_level`.\n",

    "####    - **Logistic Regression requires a larger set of features** for reasonable classification.\n",

    "### **Most Predictions are Extremely Confident**\n",
    "#### The histogram shows two strong peaks at 0 and 1, meaning the model is classifying most samples with high certainty.\n",
    "#### Very few predictions fall around the decision boundary (0.4 - 0.6 range is only 3.34%).\n",
    "#### This explains why threshold tuning doesn't impact results much—there aren’t enough ambiguous predictions near the threshold.\n",
    "###  The Optimized Threshold (0.5091) is Close to 0.5\n",
    "#### The mean probability is 0.5084, very close to the default threshold of 0.5.\n",
    "#### **The median probability is 0.5557, slightly shifted towards 1, indicating more samples predicted as stroke.**\n",
    "#### This tiny shift from 0.5 to 0.5091 has minimal impact on classification.\n",
    "### Standard Deviation Shows a Wide Spread\n",
    "#### The standard deviation of 0.4551 suggests a high variance in prediction confidence.\n",
    "#### Most samples are confidently classified (either close to 0 or close to 1), meaning relabeling with a new threshold won’t change many predictions."
